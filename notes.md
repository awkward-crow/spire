## Build & Run

```bash
cd test

make               # build all tests
make run           # build and run all tests
make TestObjectives  # build one test
./build/TestObjectives -nl 4  # multi-locale (requires GASNet)
make clean         # remove build/
```

To add a new test, append its module name to `TESTS` in `test/Makefile`.

## Design Notes

### Why row-partitioned?

Each locale owns a contiguous block of rows (all features for those
samples).  During histogram building, gradient/hessian reads are purely
local — no cross-locale traffic.  The cost is cross-locale movement
when repartitioning samples into left/right child nodes at each tree
level, offset by the histogram subtraction trick (only rebuild the
smaller child's histogram; the larger is parent minus smaller).

### Pinball loss for quantile regression

The pinball (quantile) loss is:

```
L(y, F; tau) = tau * max(y - F, 0)  +  (1 - tau) * max(F - y, 0)
```

Gradient w.r.t. F:
- `-tau`     when F < y  (under-predicted — push F up)
- `+(1-tau)` when F > y  (over-predicted  — push F down)
- `0`        when F == y

Hessian is 0 almost everywhere (piecewise linear loss), so we use the
constant approximation `hess = 1.0` — the same convention as LightGBM
and sklearn's HistGradientBoosting.

For time series applications, training separate models at e.g.
`tau = 0.1` and `tau = 0.9` gives an 80% prediction interval directly
from the GBM output without any distributional assumptions.

### Distributed quantile binning — sampling approach

**Decision: use sampling.**

Each locale draws a random subset of its local rows (e.g. `sqrt(nLocalRows)`
or a fixed cap), communicates those values to locale 0, which sorts each
feature column and picks 255 evenly-spaced quantile boundaries.  The
resulting `uint8` cut-points are broadcast back and each locale bins its
own rows independently.

Alternatives considered:

| Algorithm | Accuracy | Complexity | Why not chosen |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sampling** *(chosen)* | Approximate; improves with sample size | Low | Simple, no streaming state, same approach as XGBoost/LightGBM default |
| Greenwald-Khanna | ε-exact | High | Non-trivial merge step; overkill for initial binning pass |
| t-digest | Approximate, good tails | Medium | Better tail accuracy than sampling but adds a dependency and complexity |

For typical GBM use (255 bins, millions of rows) sampling error is
negligible — a misplaced bin boundary shifts one split threshold slightly,
which the next boosting round corrects. Exact quantiles are not worth the
implementation cost here.

### Histogram memory layout

**Decision: deferred — implement `[node, feature, bin]` first, benchmark,
then try `[feature, bin, node]` if cache misses are a bottleneck.**

During histogram accumulation the inner loop touches one `(node, feature,
bin)` cell per sample. With `[node, feature, bin]` layout, samples in the
same node and feature land in adjacent memory; with `[feature, bin, node]`
the node dimension is innermost, which may suit split-finding better.
Benchmark before optimising.

## Next Steps

Phase 2 — Histogram builder:
- `Binning.chpl`: sampling-based quantile binning → `uint8` `Xb` matrix
- `Histogram.chpl`: `buildHistograms`, subtraction trick
- `Splits.chpl`: `findBestSplits`, `SplitInfo` record
- `Tree.chpl`: node assignment, leaf values, predict

Open question remaining:
- Histogram memory layout benchmark (`[node, feature, bin]` vs `[feature, bin, node]`)
